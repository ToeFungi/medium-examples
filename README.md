# Medium Examples
This repository serves as an illustration of my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@pickeringacw) and any code
illustrations will be documented inside of an appropriately named file within this repository. 

My aim is to provide developers with a tangible and ready-to-go examples of any of the material I present in my posts
so that should anyone wish to implement or experiment, they are free to do so and have the resources required on hand.
